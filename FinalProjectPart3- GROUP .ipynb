    "In the 1st graph, we see a comparison between the number of new cases vs number of new deaths over a period of time. Through the graph we can infer that the no of cases has been increasing exponentially while there has hardly been any changes in the no of deaths. Also, when we compare the both, no of deaths is almost negligible against the no of cases. This implies that either the COVID variant isn't as strong/deadly or with time there is mass immunity amongst people that might be due to vaccinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second graph shows confirmed cases against WHO regions, thus making it more concise and clear to understand. We can see that when we hover over the bars it shows cases for different countries in each WHO region through the whole bar , however we can find the total no of cases in the whole WHO region via the y-axis. Through the graph we can see that the maximum cases were in Americas WHO region followed by Europe and then South-East Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 3rd graph, we have a pie chart showing the new cases percentage in each WHO region, and its clear from the graph that the highest is in Americas with 56.9% followed by Europe with 26.8% and so on. All these graphs help us understand the COVID scenario in different countries and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset that can help with part 3 of the project to talk more about the Covid 19 Analysis is the Covid 19 vaccination vs mortality dataset. We found this vaacine dataset on Kaggle. Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sinakaraji/covid-vaccination-vs-death. This dataset includes Total vaccinations administered, people fully vaccinated, new deaths,population, ratio, the country and iso code. With this data we can see the rate of vaccinations in a sample population,and the dates various countries  got vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team member Aditya created the fist visualization which compares the new deaths to new cases due to COVID19. This graph clearly indicates that the number of new deaths due to covid19 have reduced. Rishitha created the 2nd visualization. Initially, she tried plotting Country column on the X-axis but the number of countries were too large and graph was hard to read even after adjusting the figure size and X-axis. She then modified the 2nd visualization, which shows the number of cases in every WHO region which is more clear to understand. Bhavya created the 3rd visualization which is a pie chart that depicts new cases per WHO region. We can clearly see that maximum number of new cases are in Americas through this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "I (Team member Bhavya Kosaraju) was able to learn more about interactivity between plots and the limitations of a few packages.Our team attempted to generate a heatmap using bqplot but quickly realized that our dataset was not feasible fot it. I next looked into plotly and collaborated with my teammates to create an interactive dashboard using plotly.  Rishitha Nuka, a team member, taught me more about dashboard creation and fitting in all the elements as part of a dash app , and Aditya Misra a team member, taught me more about identifcation of the correct columns for the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Part 3 of our final project, we will be using MyBinder to host our jupyter notebook. We will be creating a visualization to show the vaccination data of different countries with an interactive slider. . We will also be creating a visualization to see if countries with more vaccinated people have less deaths due to covid 19 or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team Members Aditya and Bhavya will work on making the visualizations interactive by adding slider interactivity and a multiple line chart. Team Member Rishitha will work on trying to join the Covid 19 data with the Vaccination data and come up with another visualization which will show the how effective are the vaccines to prevent covid19.\n",
